Five years ago, I vowed to build a new personal website and start a blog that wasn’t part of a larger platform (does Github count?). 

I finally did it. I’m excited to chisel out my own corner of the internet.

Welcome.

“So what have you been doing this whole time?” you ask. 

Working. Learning. Reverting. Surviving. Cocooning. Expanding. Iterating.

Aside from other life stuff, I was working and burning out — a common tale of my generation. I was also writing a ton, but privately, in order to process what was happening at the time. This writing looked like random nuggets scattered across Notational Velocity and Simplenote pages; lightly organized but at least searchable. This was necessary and formative inner work for me, and I’m glad I was wary of the urge to “produce” something with all that “content”. 

So is this the “production”? 

Nah.

This is something else. A different exploration in writing. 

I want to get better at sharing my perspective. My hope is that having a live professional-lite blog will keep my ideas and writing focused and clear. And help hold me accountable to _honoring_ my knowledge, my perspective, and my own experiences.

Sure, I’ve done a fair amount of technical writing via documentation, given presentations, and shared my knowledge as part of my job. But that carries a different kind of weight and really isn’t the vibe I’m going for here. Not entirely sure what the vibe will be, but there’s only one way to find out, and I have lots of ideas.

Keep the internet weird. Keep it decentralized. Welcome to my own corner of the internet.
