*Warning: Meta.*

I’ve been thinking about this blog. This place.

The blog’s core is inspired by the James Baldwin quote above. It’s a quote that I think about and that centers me often when it comes to writing. I’m the type of person who needs to process and explore for myself before declaring an opinion, if declaring one at all. I’m also very susceptible to rabbit holes. There’s a playfulness in this process, exploring thoughts. There’s also a playfulness in creating a space like this site ( 😉 easter eggs 😉 ). 

So, I’d like to play with the idea of this blog having no concrete purpose.

In [“How To Do Nothing”](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/) (I can’t recommend this book enough), Jenny Odell explores how to resist the illusion of progress and capitalist technological determinism that profits from and demands our attention. Among countless beautiful reflections in the book, she suggests rooting ourselves in the public and physical realm while embracing ambiguity, nuance, complexity and so-called inefficiency:

Being ok with, even comforted and served by ambiguity. A blog isn’t going to have all the answers. No one does. There is no utopia. There’s only us humans, our fellow living creatures, and the billions of realities that make up this world. 

“...Whoa there. Ok Carol...what?”

Sure, I could utilize this space to try and prove my technical knowledge to a VC-backed company in order to get hired. Or use it as a performative declaration of my values in exchange for social media capital. Or for some other form of profit.

Or I could explore my own complex reality, ponderings and experiences without the capitalist pressures of purpose. And instead use playfulness as resistance. At best, the blog is a connective wandering that we both enjoy. At worst, it’s just another place in the digital void yet to be abandoned, which still sounds pretty cool. Even if a place is abandoned and the history forgotten, that doesn’t take away from its once held...purpose.

In honor of Jenny Odell and staying rooted in the shared physical realm: Right now, you and I are both sitting within the same atmosphere on Earth (I’m 98% sure this is a fact), and there is a New Moon arriving on October 28, 2019, at 3:38 UTC. Counseling astrologer Chani Nicholas gives a description of this new moon that feels like a fitting circling back for this post. She reminds us to focus on what matters most to us while also staying open. Here's to trusting in the process, however meandering it feels.

> “The New Moon comes with a warning. Do your work. Conserve your energy for the most important of your projects. Honor the mysteries of life. Let your self-esteem be rooted in your ability to confront life’s most challenging moments as much as it is rooted in your ability to celebrate the most joyous of them.”
